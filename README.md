# Quiz Generator

## Overview
This project is a command-line quiz application that I'm submitting as my COMP150 Term Project. The program takes a `.txt` file containing questions, categorizes them into **Multiple Choice**, **Open-Ended**, and **Fill in the Blank** questions, and quizzes the user.

## Features
1. **Question Categorization**:
   - Parses the input file into separate vectors for multiple-choice, open-ended, and fill in the blank questions.
2. **Interactive Quiz**:
   - Displays questions at random.
   - For multiple-choice questions, answers are selected and validated automatically.
   - For open-ended questions, users self-assess their responses.
   - For fill in the blank questions, it first checks if the users answer is identical to the correct one, and if not, it prompts the user to check themselves.

## Getting Started


### Input File Format
The input file should:
- Begin each question with `M` (for Multiple Choice) or `O` (for Open-Ended), followed by the question text.
- For multiple-choice questions:
  - Use `~` to denote options.
  - Include the correct answer immediately after `=` in the format `=A` (ex. "What is 2+2? ~A. Four ~B. Three =A").
- For open-ended questions:
  - Provide the answer after the punctuation mark ending the question (ex. "What is the capital of France? Paris").

### Example Input
M What is 2+2? ~A. Four ~B. Three =A 
O What is the capital of France? Paris

### Using AI to Generate Quizzes
A quiz can be easily generated by feeding ChatGPT the exampleTest.txt file and asking it to generate a quiz in that format!

2. **Running**:
